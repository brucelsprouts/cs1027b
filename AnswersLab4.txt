-----------------------------------------------



EXERCISE 1

1. Explain why there is a compiler error on each of the following lines.

a) Line 12
The if else statement isn't complete and because of that the method dos'nt work

b) Line 42
The method m1 is missing a return statement, as well as being void, this can be fixed by creating a return to the array arr.

c) Line 54
The int k is already initialized and so the int statement in the for loop isn't required, as well as the NUM_ITEMS variable not being initialized it must be and so you can fix this by putting int.
